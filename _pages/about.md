## Biography

>**Ich heiße Hong und ich habe keinen Hunger.** —— Beloved Quote in German

<p>Hi there! My name is Xu, Hong (in Chinese: 徐泓), currently I'm a Ph.D candidate at ETH Zürich in Switzerland. Most of the time I enjoyed the day'n'nightbeamtime in my lovely synchrotron hutch and took the Scooter circling around the Swiss Light Source. Well, break...that is actually not true...<p> 

Grown up in the middle east of China in a small town called Zōngyáng, I was a little boy who was luckily gifted with abundant of curiosities towards the grand world. After 4 years of bachelor studies in Beijing, the capital, I started my Journey to the West at 20 years old in 2014. Arrived in Paris CDG and the SNCF brought me to a small City called Rennes, phonetically joked as "Rain", where I spent first year of my master studies. Thanks to the great EU mobility, I continued the second year of master at LMU/TUM in Munich and commited my master disstertation at TUM Physics department. Life was never lack of suprises, I got the chance interviewed by Prof. from ETH and fortunately won the PhD position at PSI, where my three year of future begins. 

Cogito, ergo sum. —— Descartes [FR]
